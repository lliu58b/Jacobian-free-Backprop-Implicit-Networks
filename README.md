# Emory Math REU 2022: Jacobian-Free Backpropagation (JFB) for Implicit Networks
Repository for Team JFB working on the project **Fast Training of Implicit Networks with Applications in Inverse Problems** during the Emory Computatational
Math REU.
The team is mentored by Dr. Samy Wu Fung and consists of 3 undergraduate students:
1. Linghai Liu, Brown University
2. Shuaicheng Tong, UCLA
3. Lisa Zhao, UC Berkeley

In this project, we use a recently proposed JFB approach to solve the computational challenges of image deblurring using implicit networks.

This GitHub repository contains the code written for the project, a midterm presentation, and a poster.
